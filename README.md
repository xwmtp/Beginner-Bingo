# Ocarina of Time Beginner Bingo
A variation on Ocarina of Time Bingo aimed at beginners. The boards are 4x4 instead of 5x5. All the goals were taken from regular Bingo making this a good stepping stone, but the most complex goals and goals that require RBA were taken out. It can still be optimal to use RBA in some goals though.

You can find Beginner Bingo (balanced for the Japanese version of the game) at https://xwmtp.github.io/beginner-bingo/beta0.9.6.0-j/bingo.html.
